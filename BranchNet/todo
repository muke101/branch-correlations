->>consider if we need to get most mispredicting branches per benchmark, or can just go by trace. verify what branchnet does and look into input partitions
modify create_ml_datasets to create workitems out of our traces, then generate h5 files
probably going to be easier to use branchnet's weird path infrastructure
figure out how inference is run

get misprediction rate from trace
when looking at most mispredicted from gcc, look at execute rates too
